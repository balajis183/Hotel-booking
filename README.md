   - Customers browse available rooms.  
   - Select a room and proceed with the booking giving checkin and checkout.  
   - The booking status is initially set to **"Pending"**.  
   - Once the user checks the detials and confirms the booking, the status updates to **"Confirmed"**.  
   - Customers can check their booking details and status anytime.  

3. **Admin Role & Room Management:**
   - Admins can add new rooms to the system.

4. **Feedback & Support:**
